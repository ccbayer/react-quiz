				"Answers": [{
						"AnswerImage": false,
						"AnswerText": "Inertia",
						"IsCorrect": true,
						"Explanation": "Fun Fact:  Inertial mass is the more correct term, but might be confusing so keep it as “Inertia.” When talking about a football game, these terms are interchangeable."
					},
					{
						"AnswerImage": false,
						"AnswerText": "Gravity",
						"IsCorrect": false,
						"Explanation": "Gravity is a force that attracts a body toward the center of earth, or toward any other physical body having mass. The correct answer is Inertia: Linemen’s bodies have more inertia. Inertia refers to a property of matter that causes it to resist changes in velocity (speed and/or direction). The more inertia that an object has, the more mass that it has. A more massive object has a greater tendency to resist changes in its state of motion."
					},
					{
						"AnswerImage": false,
						"AnswerText": "Motion",
						"IsCorrect": false,
						"Explanation": "Motion refers to the action or process of moving or being moved. The correct answer is Inertia - Linemen’s bodies have more inertia. Inertia refers to a property of matter that causes it to resist changes in velocity (speed and/or direction). The more inertia that an object has, the more mass that it has. A more massive object has a greater tendency to resist changes in its state of motion."
					},
					{
						"AnswerImage": false,
						"AnswerText": "Flexibility",
						"IsCorrect": false,
						"Explanation": "Flexibility refers to the quality of bending easily without breaking. The correct answer is Inertia: Linemen’s bodies have more inertia. Inertia refers to a property of matter that causes it to resist changes in velocity (speed and/or direction). The more inertia that an object has, the more mass that it has. A more massive object has a greater tendency to resist changes in its state of motion."
