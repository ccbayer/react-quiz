				"AnswerText": "Wayne Walker",

			"QuestionText": "Madden NFL is a long-running, beloved football simulation video game that has been around since the late 1980's. Starting in 1999, each iteration of the game features a cover star. Which NFL player has NOT appeared on the cover of the Madden video game franchise?",

				"AnswerImage": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Madden_NFL_08_Coverart.png",
				"AnswerText": "Vince Young",
				"IsCorrect": false,
				"Explanation": "While mostly an NFL bust, Vince Young rode a successful college and early NFL career at Texas to a Madden cover in 08.
